		<h2>Contacting Me</h2>
	</header>
	<p>If you'd like to contact me (John Colburn) you can use one of these methods:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Send me an email at they.called.him.crazy@gmail.com</li>
		<li>Send me a note on DeviantArt (<a href="http://johncolburn.deviantart.com/">My Profile</a>)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I usually check my various email/notes/messages several times per day, but sometimes things get hectic and it might take me a couple days to get back to you.</p>
