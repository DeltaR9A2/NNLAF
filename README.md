Platform Support
================

It should be possible to compile this game on any platform supported by SDL2 (http://libsdl.org/) though I can only verify that it works on 64bit Linux systems. Building the game requires an up-to-date ANSI C compiler; Microsoft's Visual C compiler is NOT compliant with the current ANSI standard and will not work.
