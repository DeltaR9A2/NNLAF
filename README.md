## Compiling

This game is being developed on a 64bit Arch Linux system using the traditional GNU toolchain (make, gcc, sed, etc). The makefiles also use imagemagick and ffmpeg to 

The game is also known to compile correctly on 64bit Microsoft Windows 8; the "msvc" folder contains project files for Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 that should compile the game correctly. At present, the windows build process is still experimental and incomplete so don't expect too much from it.
